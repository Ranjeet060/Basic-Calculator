# Basic-Calculator
 In this assignment, I create a basic calculator using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The goal of this project is to develop a functional calculator that can perform arithmetic operations, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. 
The calculator responds to button clicks  and keyboard input.
The calculator follows the correct order of operations (eg. ,BODMAS).
